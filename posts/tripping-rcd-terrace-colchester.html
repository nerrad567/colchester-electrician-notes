                  <h3>RCDs, leakage and BS 7671</h3>
                  <p>
                    In a typical 30&nbsp;mA RCD-protected system, you’ll always have
                    some background earth leakage from filters, appliances and long
                    cable runs. BS&nbsp;7671 expects RCDs to operate within defined
                    trip times at certain residual currents – the device is there to
                    disconnect when leakage reaches a level that could be harmful.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The temptation is to blame the RCD and swap it, but unless
                    testing shows the device itself is faulty (failing RCD tests or
                    tripping with no connected load), the more honest approach is to
                    find and fix the sources of leakage first.
                  </p>

                  <h3>Division of installation and shared RCDs</h3>
                  <p>
                    A common theme in older properties is multiple circuits piled
                    onto a single RCD – rings, kitchen, outside sockets and sheds
                    all sharing one 30&nbsp;mA device. The Wiring Regulations
                    emphasise sensible division of the installation so a single
                    fault doesn’t take out “everything critical” in one go.
                  </p>
                  <p>In practice that means:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Not relying on one RCD to look after half the house,
                      especially where outside circuits and damp areas are involved.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Considering RCBOs or at least splitting loads so outside and
                      high-leakage circuits don’t drag the rest over the edge.
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                  <h3>How I’d frame it in a report</h3>
                  <p>
                    On an EICR or fault report, I’m usually clear about the
                    difference between:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <em
                        >“RCD nuisance tripping due to cumulative leakage from
                        multiple circuits and external loads”</em
                      >, and
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <em>“RCD/RCBO itself defective or failing testing”</em>.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    The first needs circuit-level fixes and, ideally, better circuit
                    division. The second needs a new device. Mixing them up either
                    wastes money or hides a fault instead of addressing it.
                  </p>
                </div>
              </div>
            </aside>
            <p>
              This one came in as a fairly common request:
              <em
                >“The RCD keeps tripping. Can you just change the breaker?”</em
              >
            </p>

            <p>
              If you’ve got an RCD that keeps tripping in Colchester or North Essex, bookings are
              via <a href="https://www.graylogic.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Gray Logic Electrical</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              It’s a typical older Colchester terrace – small consumer unit by
              the front door, kitchen tacked on at the back, a bit of DIY over
              the years, and a single 30&nbsp;mA RCD covering most of the
              sockets.
            </p>
            <p>
              They’d already had a couple of suggestions. One was to “upgrade
              the RCD” because “it must be too sensitive”. Another was to “stick
              a different type in” as if that magically fixes everything.
            </p>
            <p>The reality (as usual) was a bit different.</p>

            <h2>What the customer was seeing</h2>
            <p>Their report, in their own words, was roughly:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The main RCD would trip “randomly”.</li>
              <li>
                Sometimes it went as soon as they put the kettle on in the
                kitchen.
              </li>
              <li>
                Sometimes it was when the washing machine went into its heat
                cycle.
              </li>
              <li>
                Occasionally it would trip in the middle of the night with
                “nothing on”.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              By the time I arrived, half the house was unplugged and they were
              flicking breakers on and off to “see what helps”.
            <h2>First step: make it safe and stop guessing</h2>
            <p>
              Before any fault-finding, I want a safe starting point and a clear
              picture of what’s actually on that RCD. So:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Safe isolation</strong> – confirm supply off, lock off,
                prove dead.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Consumer unit open</strong> – check the general standard
                of work:
                <ul>
                  <li>Mixed brands in the board.</li>
                  <li>
                    One 30&nbsp;mA RCD feeding several MCBs, plus a cooker on
                    its own RCBO.
                  </li>
                  <li>Labels mostly wrong or missing (of course).</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Work out what’s actually on that RCD</strong>:
                <ul>
                  <li>A ring final doing most of the sockets in the house.</li>
                  <li>Kitchen sockets as a leg off the same ring.</li>
                  <li>
                    A spur out to an outside socket and a small shed supply.
                  </li>
                  <li>A boiler on a fused spur from the ring.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Nothing outrageous yet – just what you’d expect in a terrace
              that’s had “a bit added on” in the kitchen and garden over time.
            </p>

            <h2>Insulation resistance: is the wiring broadly healthy?</h2>
            <p>
              With everything safely disconnected where needed, I ran insulation
              resistance tests (L–N to CPC, N–CPC etc.) on the main circuits the
              RCD was protecting.
            </p>
            <p>The results were “okay but not perfect”:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The main ring had good readings L–N and L–E (nicely into
                megohms).
              </li>
              <li>
                N–E was a little lower than I’d like but still within a broadly
                acceptable range for an older installation.
              </li>
              <li>
                The kitchen extensions were similar – nothing screamingly bad.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              That told me we weren’t dealing with a dead short in the fixed
              wiring. There was probably some background neutral–earth leakage,
              but nothing on the test alone that said “this is definitely it”.
            </p>
            <p>
              So I’m not ripping the RCD out yet, and I’m not simply blaming
              “old wiring” either.
            </p>

            <h2>Recreating the fault: what actually makes it trip?</h2>
            <p>
              Next step is always to recreate the fault in a controlled way,
              rather than keep resetting and hoping for the best.
            </p>
            <p>
              With the cover back on and everything made safe, I powered up and
              started loading the installation in a controlled way:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Boiler on.</li>
              <li>Fridge-freezer on.</li>
              <li>A couple of general sockets in use.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Like that, the RCD sat quite happily. The first real clue came
              when the washing machine went into its heat cycle – as soon as the
              element kicked in, the RCD tripped.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unplug the washing machine, reset the RCD, run everything else: no
              trip.
            </p>
            <p>
              At this point it’d be very easy (and very common) to just say:
              <em>“It’s your washing machine, you need a new one.”</em> But I
              wanted to be sure there wasn’t something else dragging everything
              towards that 30&nbsp;mA threshold.
            </p>

            <h2>The classic terrace combo: outside sockets and damp</h2>
            <p>
              I asked the obvious questions about the outside socket and shed:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                “Does it ever trip when you’re using the lawnmower or pressure
                washer?”
              </li>
              <li>“Any issues with the shed power?”</li>
            </ul>
            <p>They mentioned a couple of things:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                After heavy rain, the RCD had tripped overnight a few times.
              </li>
              <li>
                There was a budget extension reel permanently plugged into the
                outside socket, running into the shed to feed a small heater and
                a couple of chargers.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>There’s your second suspect.</p>

            <p>
              I isolated and tested the spur to the outside socket and shed. IR
              on that leg wasn’t awful, but it was noticeably lower than the
              rest of the ring. With loads connected, there was a bit of earth
              leakage even with switches off.
            </p>
            <p>When I opened the outside socket, the picture became clearer:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Gasket missing / hanging out, so water wasn’t being kept out
                properly.
              </li>
              <li>
                Evidence of moisture inside and slightly greened terminals.
              </li>
              <li>
                The flex going to the shed had been trapped in the cover –
                pinched insulation.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Put that together and it starts to make sense: the washing machine
              is contributing some earth leakage on heat, and the outside
              socket/shed leg is adding its own leakage when damp. Add the usual
              background leakage from filters, chargers and electronics, and the
              installation is living on the edge of that 30&nbsp;mA RCD limit.
            </p>

            <h2>Why “just change the breaker” is the wrong answer</h2>
            <p>
              A lot of people jump straight to swapping the protective device:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>“RCDs go faulty – just change it.”</li>
              <li>
                “Let’s fit a less sensitive one, that’ll stop it tripping.”
              </li>
              <li>“Stick something else in, must be the breaker, right?”</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The problem is, in this case the RCD was doing exactly what it’s
              supposed to do – it was seeing enough leakage to trip.
            </p>
            <p>
              Swapping it for a brand new one without dealing with the
              underlying leakage doesn’t magically fix anything. Fitting
              something “less sensitive” might stop the nuisance trips, but it
              does it by looking the other way, not by making the installation
              safer.
            </p>

            <h2>What we actually did</h2>
            <p>
              On this job, the fix wasn’t glamorous, but it was honest and
              repeatable.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Outside socket &amp; spur</strong> – replaced the
                outside socket with a proper, weatherproof unit, re-terminated
                everything cleanly with the cable properly glanded, and made
                sure the enclosure actually sealed. Repeat tests showed a clear
                improvement in insulation resistance and leakage.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Shed supply</strong> – removed the permanent budget
                extension reel arrangement and put in a more sensible fixed
                connection so they weren’t running flex through door gaps in all
                weather.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Washing machine</strong> – re-tested with the rest of
                the circuit in a better state. The machine was still
                contributing some leakage on heat, but no longer enough on its
                own to tip the RCD. I gave them straight advice: it’s safe to
                use for now, but when it eventually gets replaced, the overall
                leakage picture will only improve.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Consumer unit labelling &amp; notes</strong> – updated
                the circuit schedule so the next person has half a chance, and
                talked through options for future upgrades (more RCBOs, better
                separation of circuits) when the board is eventually changed.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              After that, we ran it under real conditions – washer heating,
              kettle on, boiler cycling, shed loads on – and the RCD stayed put.
            </p>

            <h2>The takeaway: terraces remember every little bodge</h2>
            <p>
              In older Colchester terraces especially, you tend to see the same
              pattern repeat:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Original wiring that’s “mostly OK”.</li>
              <li>
                Small additions over the years – conservatories, outside
                sockets, sheds, kitchen tweaks.
              </li>
              <li>
                All of it landed on one RCD, with no-one ever looking at the
                overall leakage.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              So when someone says <em>“The RCD is too sensitive”</em>, what
              they often mean is:
            </p>
            <p>
              <em
                >“We’ve gradually added so many little leaks and bodges that the
                protective device is finally doing what it was designed to
                do.”</em
              >
            </p>

            <h2>When you actually might replace the RCD</h2>
            <p>
              There are times an RCD or RCBO genuinely is the problem – but you
              prove that with testing, not guesswork:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                It trips with no load connected and healthy insulation readings.
              </li>
              <li>
                It fails RCD tests (won’t trip at all, or trips wildly outside
                expected times).
              </li>
              <li>It’s visibly damaged, overheated or otherwise suspect.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In those cases, yes – replace it. But the default should be:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Test the circuits.</li>
              <li>Find the fault or cumulative leakage.</li>
              <li>Fix the cause.</li>
              <li>Then decide if the device itself needs changing.</li>
            </ol>
