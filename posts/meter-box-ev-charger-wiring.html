              <h3>Common misunderstandings (the short version)</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>“It’s locked, so it’s safe.”</strong> A lock controls
                  access. It doesn’t prove the enclosure is suitable to provide
                  basic protection for customer wiring.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>“The homeowner owns the meter box.”</strong> Ownership
                  doesn’t change what the enclosure was designed to do.
                  <em
                    >Owning a gas meter box doesn’t make it a boiler
                    cupboard.</em
                  >
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong
                    >“Supplier isolators are in there, so anything goes.”</strong
                  >
                  Supplier gear is installed under supplier authority as part of
                  the metering arrangement. That doesn’t give a free pass for
                  customer equipment.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>“It looks tidy.”</strong> Tidy isn’t the same as
                  suitable. Use a purpose-made enclosure for customer kit.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>The practical rule I work to</h3>
              <p>
                If you need to add customer equipment near the intake (EV
                isolator, small board, junctioning, etc.), fit a
                <strong>separate enclosure</strong> next to the meter position
                that’s designed to house live parts and is rated for the
                environment. Don’t repurpose the meter cabinet.
              </p>
            </aside>

            <p>
              I’m seeing more domestic meter boxes used as a “handy spare
              cupboard” for customer wiring: EV charger feeds, isolators, small
              distribution boxes, and junctions added wherever there’s space.
            </p>
            <p>
              It often looks neat. It’s outside and out of the way. And because
              many meter boxes are owned by the homeowner, it’s easy to assume:
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>“If it fits inside the meter box, it must be OK.”</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              In practice, it’s a source of problems — sometimes immediately,
              but more often later when equipment is upgraded, faults develop,
              or a meter operator needs access.
            </p>

            <h2>What a domestic meter box is actually for</h2>
            <p>
              A GRP meter cabinet is intended to house the intake and metering
              arrangement: service head / cut-out, meter, and sometimes a
              supplier-installed isolator.
            </p>
            <p>
              It’s designed for weather protection, basic security, and routine
              access for meter readers and service engineers. It is not
              generally designed, declared, or assessed as a wiring enclosure
              for customer circuits.
            </p>
            <p>
              That last sentence matters. A box can be “an enclosure” in the
              everyday sense, but that doesn’t automatically make it the sort
              of enclosure BS 7671 expects you to rely on for protecting people
              from contact with live parts.
            </p>

            <h2>Locks and keys don’t automatically make it suitable</h2>
            <p>
              A common argument is that the meter box is locked or needs a key
              to open.
            </p>
            <p>
              Access control helps, but it doesn’t answer the real question:
              is this enclosure intended to act as the protective barrier for
              live customer wiring?
            </p>
            <p>
              Meter boxes are routinely opened by people who are there to deal
              with metering equipment — not to encounter customer-installed
              wiring arrangements, junctions, or boards.
            </p>

            <h2>“But the supplier put an isolator in there…”</h2>
            <p>
              Supplier isolators are often fitted inside meter cabinets and can
              look similar to customer equipment. The difference isn’t how it
              looks — it’s responsibility and purpose.
            </p>
            <p>
              Supplier equipment is installed under supplier authority as part
              of the metering arrangement. Customer equipment isn’t. The
              presence of supplier gear doesn’t create a general permission to
              treat the meter cabinet as a customer wiring space.
            </p>

            <h2>Why adding a separate enclosure is fine (and usually best)</h2>
            <p>
              None of this means you can’t add equipment near the intake.
            </p>
            <p>
              The clean solution is to add a separate, purpose-made enclosure
              next to or below the meter cabinet — for example a small EV
              distribution enclosure or an isolator enclosure rated for outdoor
              use.
            </p>
            <p>
              These enclosures are designed to house live parts, provide a
              defined protective barrier, and be installed and maintained as
              part of the customer’s electrical installation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Put simply:
              <strong
                >you can add a proper enclosure — you shouldn’t repurpose the
                meter cabinet.</strong
              >
            </p>

            <h2>A very common EV charger trap: SWA termination inside the meter box</h2>
            <p>
              One setup I’m seeing a lot is an EV charger supply routed through
              the meter cabinet. The cable is often SWA (steel wire armoured),
              and the termination into a small enclosure is sometimes done with
              a stuffing gland rather than a proper armour-clamping gland.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most EV chargers are plastic. That means the armour is often not
              properly dealt with at the charger end (or it’s assumed “it’ll be
              fine”).
            </p>
            <p>
              If the armour isn’t correctly terminated and earthed at at least
              one end, you can end up with a floating conductive layer. That’s
              not the sort of thing you want hidden in a cabinet that gets
              opened for metering work.
            </p>

            <h2>Why this matters in practice</h2>
            <p>
              This isn’t about paperwork. It’s about future work and future
              safety.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Meter operators and DNO/supplier engineers need clear access to
                metering equipment.
              </li>
              <li>
                Extra customer kit inside the meter cabinet often leads to
                delays, refusal to work, or “clear it first” conversations.
              </li>
              <li>
                Poor termination practices (especially on EV supplies) can sit
                unnoticed until something goes wrong.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The takeaway</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Meter cabinets are for the metering arrangement — not a general
                customer wiring enclosure.
              </li>
              <li>
                A lock doesn’t automatically make an enclosure suitable to rely
                on for customer wiring protection.
              </li>
              <li>
                Supplier equipment doesn’t mean “anything goes”.
              </li>
              <li>
                If you need to add customer equipment at the intake, fit a
                separate enclosure that’s designed for it.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Need help untangling an intake / EV setup in Colchester?</h2>
            <p>
              If you’ve got an EV charger feed, isolator, or other customer
              wiring stuffed into a meter box and you want a cleaner, safer
              arrangement, I can inspect what you’ve got and propose a sensible
              layout that’s maintainable and future-proof.
