            <p>
              It’s increasingly common to see customer wiring installed inside
              domestic meter boxes — EV charger supplies, isolators, Henleys,
              small distribution enclosures, and various “it’ll do” junctioning.
              The reasoning is usually practical: the space exists, it’s
              external, and in many cases the homeowner owns the cabinet.
            </p>

            <p>
              However, this practice causes repeated problems — not because of
              personal preference or “what inspectors like”, but because
              <strong>meter cabinets are not accepted or managed as spaces for
                customer wiring</strong>, and because real electrical shortcomings
              often appear once they’re used that way.
            </p>

            <h2>
              1) Meter cabinets aren’t accepted as customer wiring spaces
              <span class="sr-only">(and this is not a BS 7671 rule)</span>
            </h2>

            <p>
              It’s important to be clear from the outset:
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong
                >There is no regulation in BS 7671 that explicitly forbids
                customer wiring inside a meter cabinet.</strong
              >
            </p>

            <p>
              However, that does <em>not</em> mean meter cabinets are accepted or
              suitable spaces for customer wiring — and the reason has nothing
              to do with opinion.
            </p>

            <h3>Where the restriction actually comes from</h3>
            <p>
              Domestic meter cabinets sit in a boundary space between the
              customer installation and the electricity supply network. They’re
              governed in practice by:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>DNO / supplier safety duties, and</li>
              <li>meter operator access requirements,</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              not by BS 7671 design rules.
            </p>

            <p>
              Industry and government guidance is explicit (see the references in
              the technical note). The practical takeaway is simple:
              metering equipment needs clear, safe access, and the meter cabinet
              is treated as “metering space”, not a general-purpose customer
              wiring enclosure.
            </p>

            <h3>Why “the customer doesn’t care what the DNO says” isn’t a defence</h3>
            <p>
              From a customer’s perspective, this usually only becomes relevant
              later — when a smart meter is fitted, when an upgrade is requested,
              when the cut-out/service head needs work, or when a safety issue
              arises. At that point, if the metering space is considered unsafe
              or unsuitable, work simply won’t proceed until it’s resolved.
            </p>

            <h2>2) Why ownership doesn’t make an enclosure “suitable”</h2>
            <p>
              A common argument is that the homeowner owns the meter cabinet,
              therefore it can be used as they wish. Ownership doesn’t change
              suitability.
            </p>

            <p>
              A better way to think about it is this:
              <strong
                >owning a weatherproof storage box doesn’t make it an electrical
                enclosure.</strong
              >
              If it hasn’t been designed and declared to provide the required
              protection for live parts, you can’t treat it as though it has.
            </p>

            <p>
              That aligns with general BS 7671 principles around equipment being
              suitable for the application and installed in accordance with
              intended use and instructions (e.g. Regs 133.1.1 and 134.1.1).
            </p>

            <h2>3) Supplier isolators don’t create permission</h2>
            <p>
              Supplier isolators are often fitted inside meter cabinets and are
              frequently used as justification for adding customer equipment.
              They don’t create permission.
            </p>
            <p>
              Supplier equipment sits under supplier authority as part of the
              metering arrangement. Customer-installed equipment does not share
              that status, even if it looks similar.
            </p>

            <h2>4) Where BS 7671 becomes relevant (accurately)</h2>
            <p>
              BS 7671 doesn’t care that a cable passes through a meter cabinet.
              It becomes relevant when compliance relies on conditions in that
              space. Typical triggers include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Basic protection</strong> being provided by
                barriers/enclosures (Regs 416.2, 416.2.1, 416.2.4)
              </li>
              <li>
                Reliance on <strong>degree of protection (IP)</strong> for
                accessories/terminations (linking back to suitability, Reg
                133.1.1)
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Mechanical protection</strong> of wiring systems (Reg
                522.8.1) and avoiding mechanical strain at terminations (Reg
                522.8.5)
              </li>
              <li><strong>Sound connections</strong> (Reg 526.1)</li>
              <li>
                <strong>Earthing / PE integrity</strong> where relied upon
                (Chapter 54; and 411.3.1.1 where applicable)
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              The key question BS 7671 asks isn’t “is it a meter box?”. It’s:
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>What is providing the protection you’re relying on, and is
                it suitable?</strong>
            </p>

            <h2>5) Meter tails and “basic insulation” — what the real issue is</h2>
            <p>
              Meter tails are typically <strong>double insulated</strong>. The
              usual problem is not “tails exist in a meter box” — it’s what
              often happens at terminations:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>insulation stripped back too far</li>
              <li>basic insulation visible outside an enclosure</li>
              <li>
                poor entry/retention arrangements leaving conductors unsupported
                or vulnerable
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Once stripped insulation or exposed basic insulation exists in a
              space, the discussion returns to basic protection by barriers or
              enclosures (Regs 416.2 series), suitability (Reg 133.1.1),
              workmanship and intended use (Reg 134.1.1), mechanical strain/support
              (Reg 522.8.5), and soundness of connections (Reg 526.1).
            </p>

            <h2>6) EV charger supplies: SWA termination and armour earthing</h2>
            <p>
              EV work is where meter-box installs most often go wrong.
            </p>

            <p>
              A common pattern is: SWA EV feed enters the meter cabinet, the SWA
              is terminated into a small customer enclosure inside, and the
              termination is done with a <strong>stuffing gland</strong> rather
              than a BW/CW type armour gland.
            </p>

            <h3>a) Mechanical termination and strain relief</h3>
            <p>
              Stuffing glands may grip the sheath, but they don’t properly
              terminate the armour. That can leave terminations mechanically
              weak and put stress onto inner conductors.
            </p>
            <p>
              Relevant regs/principles: avoiding mechanical strain and providing
              appropriate support (Reg 522.8.5), sound connections (Reg 526.1),
              and proper workmanship (Reg 134.1.1).
            </p>

            <h3>b) Armour earthing (especially with plastic EV chargers)</h3>
            <p>
              Many EV chargers are plastic. In practice that often means the
              armour isn’t properly dealt with at the EV unit end. If it’s also
              not correctly terminated at the supply end, the armour may be
              floating.
            </p>
            <p>
              Under a core-to-armour fault, that can affect fault conditions and
              what clears what. The design must ensure the protective measures
              are effective, and the installation must verify this by test.
            </p>

            <h2>7) The correct approach</h2>
            <p>
              If customer equipment is required near the intake:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Install a separate, purpose-designed enclosure</strong>
                rated for the environment (Reg 133.1.1).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Keep customer wiring and terminations out of the meter
                  cabinet</strong>
                unless there’s a clear reason and protective measures are not
                being compromised.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Terminate SWA correctly</strong> (correct gland, correct
                earthing method, tested and verified) (Reg 526.1; Reg 522.8.5;
                Chapter 54).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Leave the meter cabinet for metering equipment only</strong>
                (aligns with published guidance and avoids access disputes).
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Takeaway</h2>
            <p>
              This isn’t about claiming BS 7671 “bans” customer wiring in meter
              cabinets — it doesn’t.
            </p>
            <p>
              It’s about recognising two realities:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                the metering space is intended and enforced as metering-only
                (industry/government guidance), and
              </li>
              <li>
                BS 7671 becomes relevant when protection, IP performance,
                termination integrity or earthing relies on the conditions inside
                that space.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The simplest, cleanest solution remains:
              <strong>Add a proper enclosure. Don’t repurpose the meter cabinet.</strong>
            </p>
