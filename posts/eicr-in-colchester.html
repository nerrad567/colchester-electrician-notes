          <section class="article-body">
            <p>
              I get a lot of calls that start the same way:
              <em>“We just need an EICR.”</em> Sometimes it’s a landlord,
              sometimes an estate agent, sometimes a homeowner who’s been told
              they “need one for the paperwork”.
            </p>

            <p>
              An EICR isn’t just “plug a tester in and print a certificate”.
              Here’s what I actually do on a typical EICR around Colchester and
              what I’m looking for while I’m in your house or premises.
            </p>

            <h2>1. A walk-through before tools come out</h2>
            <p>
              Before I even get the tester out, I’ll do a quick walk-through:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Where’s the consumer unit? How old is it? Any obvious damage?
              </li>
              <li>
                What’s been added over the years – extensions, loft rooms, EV,
                showers?
              </li>
              <li>
                Any signs of heat damage, DIY wiring, or old rewirable fuses?
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This sets the context. An EICR on a 1960s house with bits added by
              different people over 40 years is very different from a recent new
              build.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Safe isolation and basic checks</h2>
            <p>
              Before I start taking covers off, I’ll isolate safely and make
              sure I’m not about to put anyone in the dark unexpectedly. Then:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Check main earthing and bonding are present and sized correctly.
              </li>
              <li>
                Look for obvious signs of overheating or poor terminations.
              </li>
              <li>
                Confirm what each circuit is actually doing (not just what the
                label says).
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Testing each circuit properly</h2>
            <p>
              This is the part most people never see, but it’s where the actual
              data comes from. Depending on the job and access, I’ll be looking
              at things like:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Insulation resistance between conductors (is the wiring breaking
                down?).
              </li>
              <li>
                Continuity of protective conductors (will the CPC actually do
                its job?).
              </li>
              <li>RCD testing – do they trip within the required times?</li>
              <li>Earth fault loop impedance at key points on each circuit.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              On older properties in Colchester – especially terraces and older
              semis – this is where long-forgotten junction boxes, buried joints
              and DIY add-ons tend to show up.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Coding issues: C1, C2, C3 &amp; FI</h2>
            <p>
              The report doesn’t just say “pass” or “fail”. Each item is coded:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>C1</strong> – dangerous, needs immediate action.</li>
              <li>
                <strong>C2</strong> – potentially dangerous, needs urgent work.
              </li>
              <li><strong>C3</strong> – improvement recommended.</li>
              <li><strong>FI</strong> – further investigation required.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>On a lot of Colchester rentals, I see things like:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                No RCD protection on socket circuits likely to be used outdoors
                (often C2).
              </li>
              <li>
                Broken accessories, exposed live parts or damaged cables
                (C1/C2).
              </li>
              <li>
                Consumer units that look neat but don’t meet current protection
                requirements (often C2/C3 depending on specifics).
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Plain-English explanations, not just codes</h2>
            <p>
              A good EICR should stand up if a different electrician reads it in
              a few years’ time – and it should still make sense to you.
            </p>
            <p>When I issue an EICR, I’ll explain:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>What the main issues are.</li>
              <li>Which items are urgent vs. “keep an eye on it”.</li>
              <li>
                What sensible next steps look like for your particular
                installation.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>So, what does “satisfactory” actually mean?</h2>
            <p>
              “Satisfactory” doesn’t mean perfect. It means that, based on the
              sample inspected and the tests carried out, the installation is
              not presenting unacceptable risk under the current standards.
            </p>
            <p>
              On older properties, there are often a few C3s and the odd quirk
              that’s safe but no longer how we’d do it today. The important bit
              is that you understand what’s there and what the plan is going
              forward.
            </p>

            <h2>Need an EICR in Colchester?</h2>
            <p>
              If you’re in or around Colchester and need an EICR that’s more
              than a box-ticking exercise, this is exactly the kind of work I do
              day to day.
