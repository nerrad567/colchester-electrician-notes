              DMX stage lighting faults in a Colchester public building

              Written by Darren Gray · Gray Logic Electrical · Colchester
            </p>
          </header>

          <section class="article-body">
            <p>
              This one started as:
              <em>“The stage lights are playing up again.”</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              A public building in the Colchester area had a DMX stage lighting
              system feeding a mix of moving-head “robot” lights and uplighters.
              Some fittings wouldn’t come on, others worked intermittently, and
              the mixer desk kept “forgetting” the sliders.
            </p>
            <p>
              On jobs like this, you’re really fault-finding two systems at the
              same time:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The extra-low-voltage (ELV) control side – DMX over XLR/XMR
                cabling.
              </li>
              <li>The mains electrical installation feeding it all.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What was going wrong on the DMX side</h2>
            <p>
              Once I’d traced the line and done some basic checks, a few issues
              showed up quickly:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Damaged cabling between outlets</strong> – several of
                the XLR runs between wall outlets had physical damage: crushed
                sections and poor terminations. That’s enough to cause
                intermittent data faults and random behaviour on a DMX line.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Damaged patch leads to the lights</strong> – the leads
                from outlets to multiple “robot” uplighters were also in poor
                condition. Move the cable and the light would drop off the
                universe or flicker.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Fixtures that had lost their addresses</strong> – a
                number of the uplighters had lost their DMX addresses, so they
                were no longer listening where the desk expected them to. On a
                mixed system, that quickly turns into “nothing is doing what the
                sliders say”.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>A faulty plug into the mixer desk</strong> – the XLR
                plug on the entry into the desk was cracked and poorly
                terminated, giving another intermittent fault right where the
                signal starts.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Mixer desk losing its memory</strong> – the desk itself
                wasn’t holding on to its programming. Inside, the backup battery
                had leaked onto the PCB. That battery wasn’t realistically
                serviceable in situ and, once electrolyte has leaked on the
                board, reliability is gone even if you can physically change it.
              </li>
            </ul>

              <h3>Band I vs Band II segregation – BS 7671 Reg 528.1</h3>
              <p>
                In BS 7671:2018+A2:2022, DMX control lines are typically treated
                as Band I extra-low-voltage signalling/control, while 230 V
                lighting and power circuits are Band II.
              </p>
              <p>
                Regulation 528.1 covers the segregation of circuits of different
                bands. In short:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Band I and Band II circuits shouldn’t share a wiring system
                  unless all conductors are insulated for the highest voltage
                  present,
                </li>
                <li>
                  or they are separated by an earthed metal screen or partition,
                </li>
                <li>
                  or they are installed in separate compartments / otherwise
                  physically segregated.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>In this installation:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Band II (230 V) and Band I (ELV DMX) conductors shared the
                  same back box and faceplate.
                </li>
                <li>
                  There was no partition or compartmentalisation within the box.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The ELV terminations were DIY spades and XLR tails not
                  designed as LV accessories.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The only “separation” was 20–40 mm of air and basic insulation
                  – easily defeated by a loose spade connector or someone
                  pushing cables back into the box.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                On that basis, it’s hard to argue that the requirements of Reg
                528.1 for segregation between Band I and Band II circuits were
                being met.
              </p>

              <h3>SELV/PELV principles – Section 414</h3>
              <p>
                Where ELV circuits are provided as SELV/PELV systems, Section
                414 of BS 7671 applies. In simple terms, SELV/PELV circuits
                should be:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Protectively separated from LV circuits (double/reinforced
                  insulation, or basic insulation plus an earthed
                  screen/barrier),
                </li>
                <li>
                  Arranged such that a single fault on the LV side cannot make
                  the SELV/PELV parts live,
                </li>
                <li>
                  Verified (e.g. by insulation resistance) as being sufficiently
                  separated from other circuits and, for SELV, from earth.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                In a shared back box with no partition, basic insulation only
                and loose terminations, you can’t realistically claim the kind
                of protective separation that Section 414 is aiming at. A single
                loose 230 V conductor could energise the ELV terminals or the
                shell of an XLR connector.
              </p>
              <p>
                Even if the DMX gear is technically FELV rather than SELV/PELV,
                the principle is the same: either you treat it as LV (and design
                everything accordingly), or you keep it properly segregated from
                LV.
              </p>

              <h3>How I’d describe it on inspection</h3>
              <p>
                In inspection/reporting terms in a public building, I’d
                typically reference:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Reg 528.1 – segregation of Band I/Band II circuits sharing the
                  same enclosure.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Section 414 – separation principles for SELV/PELV-type
                  circuits from LV.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>Example wording:</p>
              <p>
                <em
                  >“LV lighting circuits and ELV control (DMX/XLR) share back
                  boxes and faceplates with no internal partition. DIY
                  terminations and basic insulation only, approx. 20–40 mm
                  separation between Band II and Band I conductors. Does not
                  meet BS 7671 requirements for segregation of Band I/Band II
                  circuits (Reg 528.1) or the separation principles for
                  SELV/PELV-type circuits from LV (Section 414). Risk that LV
                  could appear on ELV connectors under a single fault. Recommend
                  replacement with compliant accessories and separated wiring
                  systems.”</em
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                Coding wise, I’d be comfortable with a C2 (“potentially
                dangerous” – urgent remedial work required).
              </p>
            </aside>
            <h2>What I did on the day</h2>
            <p>On the control side I:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Repaired and/or replaced damaged ELV (DMX) cabling where it was
                practical to do so.
              </li>
              <li>
                Re-addressed the affected fixtures so they lined up again with
                the console’s channel layout.
              </li>
              <li>
                Confirmed the mixer desk had a hardware fault due to a leaking
                backup battery and recommended replacement rather than
                attempting to rescue it.
              </li>
              <li>
                Showed the client how to re-create a basic show layout (key
                addresses and channels) if the desk loses power or forgets its
                memory again, and left a simple printed step-by-step guide with
                the console so staff can recover a workable setup for events
                until the desk is replaced.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The end result on the day was a working (but clearly tired)
              system, with a clear recommendation that the controller itself
              needs replacing.
            </p>

            <h2>The more serious part: electrical safety issues</h2>
            <p>
              Alongside the DMX faults, there were a number of mains electrical
              issues that shouldn’t have been there – and certainly not in a
              public building.
            </p>
            <p>
              These sections had been installed by AV contractors rather than
              electrical installers. Issues included:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong
                  >230 V and ELV control sharing the same back box and
                  plate</strong
                >
                – mains lighting supply (Band II) and extra-low-voltage control
                cabling (Band I, e.g. DMX) were running into the same back box
                and faceplate with no internal barriers or compartments. There
                was only basic insulation and roughly 20–40 mm of air between
                terminations.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong
                  >Home-made XLR inlets/outlets next to 230 V power</strong
                >
                – DIY XLR inlets and outlets on plates that also carried 230 V
                twist-style power connectors. On the rear, some of the
                terminations were just spade connectors that were barely
                attached.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Poor access – outlets hidden behind pillars</strong> –
                many of these plates were tucked behind pillars or in other
                hard-to-reach spots. That makes inspection and maintenance
                difficult and encourages more bodging over time.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              None of this is the sort of thing you want hidden in the fabric of
              a building that’s open to the public.
            </p>
            <p>On the day I:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Repaired the ELV control wiring sufficiently to restore reliable
                operation.
              </li>
              <li>
                Documented and explained the electrical safety concerns to the
                client in plain language – where they were, why they’re a
                problem, and what the risks are.
              </li>
              <li>
                Recommended a full replacement of the mixer desk rather than
                attempting to repair a unit with a leaking battery and damaged
                PCB.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Our recommendation to the client</h2>
            <p>
              After restoring an acceptable level of operation, I provided a
              quotation to:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Replace the existing mix of plates with proper, compliant
                outlets that keep mains and control wiring correctly separated.
              </li>
              <li>
                Install more rugged cabling and connectors designed for repeated
                plugging/unplugging and movement.
              </li>
              <li>
                Upgrade to more robust, higher-output fixtures where
                appropriate, so the system is not only safer but also more
                capable and easier for staff to operate.
              </li>
            </ul>
