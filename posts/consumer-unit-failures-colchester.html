            <p>
              At a glance a consumer unit (fuseboard) can look perfectly serviceable: the cover is
              intact, breakers reset normally, there’s no obvious heat damage, and the installation
              appears to run without nuisance tripping. So when an EICR highlights the board —
              sometimes with a C2 — it’s reasonable to ask why.
            </p>

            <p>
              The key point is this: an EICR is not a “does the power work?” check. It’s a safety
              assessment of condition, protection and how the installation behaves under fault
              conditions. A fuseboard can supply power day-to-day while still having defects or
              missing protections that increase the risk of electric shock or fire.
            </p>

            <p>
              If you need an EICR in Colchester or North Essex (or you’ve been told your consumer
              unit “failed” and want a clear plan), bookings are handled via
              <a href="https://www.graylogic.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Gray Logic Electrical</a>.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
              This comes up a lot around Colchester and across Essex because properties change over
              time. Circuits get extended, outbuildings get fed, kitchens get refitted, and "small
              additions" build up over the years. The board can still look fine — but the protection
              and internal condition may not match what the installation is actually doing today.
            </p>

            <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">1) What the EICR codes mean (and what counts as a "fail")</h2>
            <p>
              EICR observations are coded to show severity. This matters, because not every comment
              means “unsafe” and not every observation means “replace the consumer unit”.
            </p>

            <ul style="margin: 1.5rem 0; line-height: 1.8;">
              <li><strong>C1:</strong> Danger present — immediate action required.</li>
              <li><strong>C2:</strong> Potentially dangerous — urgent remedial action required.</li>
              <li><strong>C3:</strong> Improvement recommended.</li>
              <li><strong>FI:</strong> Further investigation required.</li>
            </ul>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
              An EICR is classed as <strong>unsatisfactory</strong> if it contains at least one
              <strong>C1</strong>, <strong>C2</strong> or <strong>FI</strong>. A report made up of
              <strong>C3</strong> items can still be <strong>satisfactory</strong>.
            </p>

            <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">2) "Grandfathering": older equipment can be non-current but still safe</h2>
            <p>
              Wiring standards change over time. Existing installations are not automatically unsafe
              just because they don’t match the latest edition of BS 7671 in every detail. In
              practice, older consumer units can remain in service where their condition is good and
              the safety fundamentals are sound.
            </p>

            <p>
              This is where confusion often starts. People hear “not to current regs” and assume it
              means “must be replaced”. Often it simply means “this could be improved”, which is
              exactly what <strong>C3</strong> is for.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
              The important distinction is this: <strong>outdated</strong> is not the same as
              <strong>unsafe</strong>. EICR coding is based on risk — danger present, potential
              danger, or improvement — not on age or appearance alone.
            </p>

              <h3 style="margin-top: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; font-size: 0.95rem;">"Non-current" vs "potentially dangerous" on an EICR</h3>
              <p>
                A consumer unit can be older or “not to latest edition” without being unsafe. For
                periodic inspection, the coding should be driven by risk and verification — not
                simply by age or the fact that newer boards would be built differently.
              </p>
              <p>
                In practice, a C2 linked to the consumer unit is normally justified by one of these:
              </p>
              <ul style="margin: 1.2rem 0; line-height: 1.8;">
                <li>
                  <strong>Enclosure / barriers:</strong> missing blanks, insecure cover, openings or
                  damage that creates a realistic risk of access to live parts.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Thermal damage:</strong> signs of overheating at terminations, neutral bar
                  connections, busbar interfaces, or device bodies.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Functional failure:</strong> protective devices not operating correctly on
                  test (RCD/RCBO behaviour, main switch issues, etc.).
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Fundamentals:</strong> earthing / bonding deficiencies that materially
                  affect fault protection (disconnection, touch voltage risk).
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3 style="margin-top: 1.8rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">RCD additional protection – where judgement actually sits</h3>
              <p>
                “No RCD” is not automatically a C2. In domestic work, the real question is whether
                the absence of additional protection creates a realistic increased risk in the
                installation as used — for example sockets likely to supply outdoor equipment, or
                circuits in locations/arrangements where additional protection is expected.
              </p>
              <p>
                A good report makes that link explicit: it states the circuit, the protective measure
                missing, and the reason it is considered a foreseeable risk in that property (rather
                than just “18th edition”).
              </p>

              <h3 style="margin-top: 1.8rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Protection mismatch – when "just fit a smaller breaker" isn't viable</h3>
              <p>
                Where alterations have changed the circuit characteristics (routing, grouping,
                insulation, extensions), it's common to find that the protective device rating no
                longer aligns with the cable/circuit.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sometimes downrating the device is the correct remedy. Sometimes it isn't practical:
              </p>
              <ul style="margin: 1.2rem 0; line-height: 1.8;">
                <li>
                  <strong>Device availability / compatibility:</strong> older boards may have
                  obsolete ranges where a correct device simply isn’t available, and “making
                  something fit” undermines the integrity of the assembly.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>The wiring is the limiting factor:</strong> downrating may produce
                  persistent tripping without addressing the underlying design/usage — the correct
                  fix is often circuit correction, splitting loads, or a new circuit.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The key point: a protection mismatch can justify a serious observation, but it does
                not automatically mean “replace the consumer unit”. The remedial action should match
                the defect: device change where appropriate and supported, or circuit-side redesign
                where that’s the real issue.
              </p>

            </aside>

            <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">3) Why a consumer unit can legitimately receive a C2</h2>
            <p>
              A <strong>C2</strong> means there is a realistic safety concern. Not “it will fail
              tomorrow”, but “if a fault occurs, the installation may not protect people or property
              as it should”.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">These are the most common fuseboard-related reasons a C2 is justified:</p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.8rem;">A) Potential access to live parts</h3>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
              Missing or insecure blanks, damaged cover fixings, openings in the enclosure, or poor
              cable entries can all create a realistic risk. A board can look tidy from the outside
              but still present a problem once inspected properly.
            </p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.8rem;">B) Evidence of overheating or thermal damage</h3>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
              Loose terminations and stressed connections cause heat. Signs can include
              discolouration, melted insulation, heat-damaged devices, or overheating around
              busbar/neutral connections. These are not "cosmetic" findings — they're early warning
              signs.
            </p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.8rem;">C) Protective devices not operating correctly</h3>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
              If an RCD/RCBO or other protective device does not operate as it should, it cannot be
              relied upon for safety. That becomes a real problem under fault conditions. A device
              that doesn't perform properly is not something you ignore because "everything seems to
              work".
            </p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.8rem;">D) Earthing and bonding concerns linked to safety</h3>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
              A consumer unit doesn't exist in isolation. If the earthing arrangement is
              questionable, the main earthing conductor is inadequate, or bonding is missing/poor in
              a way that creates a realistic risk, that can drive urgent remedial action.
            </p>

            <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">4) RCD/RCBO protection: what matters in the real world</h2>
            <p>
              Customers often assume RCDs are just a “new regs thing”. They aren’t. They’re a
              life-safety measure designed to reduce the risk of fatal shock when something goes
              wrong.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.2rem;">The practical problems I see are usually one of these:</p>

            <ul style="margin: 1.2rem 0; line-height: 1.8;">
              <li>
                <strong>No additional protection where it’s realistically needed:</strong> for
                example where socket circuits are likely to supply outdoor equipment, or where cables
                are concealed in walls in typical domestic situations.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Protection present but not dependable:</strong> devices that fail testing or
                show signs of incorrect operation.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Everything on one device:</strong> not automatically unsafe, but it can be a
                weakness (one trip takes out lighting, heating, refrigeration, etc.).
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
              A competent EICR should explain the <strong>risk</strong> being addressed — not simply
              state "needs RCD because regs".
            </p>

            <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">5) When the breaker doesn't match the cable (protection mismatch)</h2>
            <p>
              One of the most common hidden problems is where the protective device rating no longer
              matches the cable size, cable route, or how the circuit now behaves after years of
              alterations. The installation can still “work” — but protection may not be doing its
              job when it matters.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.2rem;">
              This typically appears after changes such as kitchen refits, garage conversions, added
              outdoor supplies, outbuildings, or general "small additions" over the years.
            </p>

            <ul style="margin: 1.2rem 0; line-height: 1.8;">
              <li>
                <strong>Oversized protection:</strong> a device rated too high for the cable or
                installation method, increasing the risk of overheating under overload/fault.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Altered circuits:</strong> changes over time that affect how the circuit
                shares load or how it’s installed (and therefore what protection is appropriate).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Extensions without design review:</strong> additions made without checking
                the protective device, cable capacity and fault protection requirements.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.2rem;">
              Customers often ask: "Can't you just fit a smaller breaker?" Sometimes that is the
              correct fix. Sometimes it isn't possible or isn't sensible.
            </p>

            <ul style="margin: 1.2rem 0; line-height: 1.8;">
              <li>
                <strong>Compatibility:</strong> older consumer units may have obsolete device ranges,
                meaning the correct protective device simply isn’t available for that board.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>The wiring is the real limitation:</strong> if the circuit can’t reliably
                support normal use at a lower rating, “downrating” can lead to constant tripping
                without solving the underlying design issue.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>The right fix may be on the circuit:</strong> splitting a circuit, correcting
                alterations, or installing a new circuit can be the correct remedy.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
              The right approach is always: identify the reason for the mismatch and select the
              cleanest remedy. It is not automatically "new consumer unit", and it should not be
              presented that way.
            </p>

            <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">6) Why a photo of a fuseboard proves very little</h2>
            <p>
              A photo can show a tidy installation, but it cannot show what an EICR is actually
              assessing: internal condition, correct termination, overheating signs, correct
              protective arrangements, and whether safety devices operate correctly.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
              That's why "it looks fine" doesn't settle it either way. Inspection and testing do.
            </p>

            <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">7) When replacement is sensible (and when it isn't)</h2>
            <p>
              Many issues can be resolved without changing the entire consumer unit — for example
              correcting terminations, replacing a faulty device, reinstating blanks, improving
              identification, or correcting specific circuit defects.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.2rem;">Replacement becomes a sensible recommendation where:</p>

            <ul style="margin: 1.2rem 0; line-height: 1.8;">
              <li>there is thermal damage affecting the assembly</li>
              <li>the enclosure integrity is compromised</li>
              <li>devices are obsolete and suitable replacements aren’t available</li>
              <li>
                the board cannot be upgraded safely without creating an unreliable “patchwork” outcome
              </li>
              <li>
                the overall design needs a proper reset to bring protection up to a safe standard
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
              In short: replacement should be linked to condition, safety function and suitability —
              not simply to age or appearance.
            </p>

            <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">8) Landlords and tenanted properties</h2>
            <p>
              If the property is rented, an EICR isn’t just “useful information” — it forms part of
              your electrical safety obligations. Where an EICR is unsatisfactory (C1/C2/FI), remedial
              work or further investigation is required and should be documented properly.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
              If you're a landlord and you've been handed an unsatisfactory report, the correct next
              step is to address the coded items promptly and keep the paperwork trail (report,
              remedials and certification).
            </p>

            <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">9) What a consumer unit replacement involves (plain English)</h2>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
              A fuseboard change is not a "quick swap". Done properly, it's planned work with testing
              and certification at the end.
            </p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.8rem;">A) Checks before anything is changed</h3>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
              Before a new consumer unit is fitted, the supply and safety fundamentals are confirmed:
              earthing arrangement, main bonding, the condition of tails and connections, and whether
              any existing faults would make reconnection unsafe.
            </p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.8rem;">B) Safe isolation and installation</h3>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
              The supply is isolated safely, the new consumer unit is installed, and each circuit is
              re-terminated correctly. Entries and blanks are finished properly, labeling is updated,
              and the installation is left robust and serviceable.
            </p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.8rem;">C) Verification and certification</h3>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
              The installation is then tested and verified to confirm safety and correct operation.
              You should receive the correct certification for the work (typically an Electrical
              Installation Certificate for a consumer unit change).
            </p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.8rem;">D) Building Regulations notification (England &amp; Wales)</h3>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
              Replacing a consumer unit is notifiable work under Building Regulations. When carried
              out by a registered electrician, it is normally notified through their scheme and you
              receive the relevant compliance confirmation.
            </p>

            <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">10) What to do if your fuseboard has been flagged</h2>
            <ol style="margin: 1.5rem 0; line-height: 1.8;">
              <li>
                <strong>Read the observation, not just the headline.</strong> What exactly was coded and why?
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Check the code.</strong> C3 is an improvement; C2/FI needs action.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Ask for a clear explanation.</strong> What is the actual risk: shock, fire, device failure, access to live parts?
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>If it’s rented, keep the paperwork trail.</strong> Report, remedials and certificates.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>If it’s not clearly explained, get it reviewed.</strong> A competent electrician should be able to justify the coding.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">The bottom line</h2>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
              A consumer unit can look fine and still be flagged on an EICR — because safety is about
              condition and protection under fault conditions, not how tidy the cover looks.
            </p>
